                <blockquote>
                    “In almost all the interviews that I give, I often talk about how the process is more important than the result, the result is just a by-product of the process. But in today’s world, we are so focused on the byproduct that we get away from the process. So take care of the process, all the small things and eventually you will get the desired result. We often complain that we should have gotten more as a result but actually, we got whatever we had prepared for. If we prepare well, we execute well, if we are honest to ourselves more often than not, we will get the desired result. And if there is a shortcoming then there is always learning,”

Whenever Dhoni hit a six in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket matches, he was gifted Rs 50 by Deval Sahay, who selected him for CCL. With the help of his excellent performance, CCL moved to A division.

For the 1999-2000 season, he got selected in the senior Bihar Ranji Team at the age of 18.
